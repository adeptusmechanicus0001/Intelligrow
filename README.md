This repository was created for RVCE 8thMile Hardware Hackathon, where we participated with the below idea.

Problem Statement :
  Most available implementations of smart and automated gardening systems are just automations of simple tasks like watering and lighting. 
  They're not truly smart but merely automated. They do not really help an enthusiast or a hobbyist to learn more about gardening. 
  We aim to solve this using a intelligent gardening system that leverages Ai and ML algorithms to make the system truly smart but more importantly, intelligent!
  
  We have used LobeAI and Tensorflow to create a ML model that categorizes different species of plants and detects the diseases ailing it, if any, and suggests remedies
  for the same.
  It also learns about the surrounding environment with the array of sensors provided and leverages the Power of AI and ML to provide guidance and assistance to the user
  on effectively running their garden and thus giving the users a tool to learn horticultre and gardening.
  
Materials used:
  rasbery pi4
  ESP-32
  PH sensor
  Humidity sensor
  temperature sensor
  soil moisture sensor
  
  
  The codes for the above are attached.
